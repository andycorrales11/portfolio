                    Hi! I am Andres Corrales, I am a Computer Engineering student at Texas A&M
                    University in College Station. I grew up in Monterrey, Mexico,
                    and then Houston, Texas.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 font-mono">
                    Above all, I enjoy learning, acquiring knowledge, and sharing that knowledge. If anything, that is
                    what has driven me since I was a child.
                    This manifests itself in my wide array of hobbies, interests, and passions.
                    In fact, I would be willing to wager that you and I share at least one common interest,
                    whether that is in sports, music, film, technology, history, sociology, fashion,
                    politics, philosophy, visual arts, or any other topic. I relish in discussions
                    , whether they are agreements or disagreements, and in my free time if I am
                    not enjoying the company of other people I am diving deep into Wikipedia
                    rabbit holes about whichever topic I have deemed myself not knowedgable enough in.
                </p>

                    This site will continue to evolve as my interests and skills do.
                    I try to think of it as scultpure I am carving away, revealing a clearer picture
                    of my brain every time I push to production. I will try to make it as genuine as possible,
                    both as a way to market myself but also so it serves a seperate functional purpose for
                    myself as a journal of my journey.
